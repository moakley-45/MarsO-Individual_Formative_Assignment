                            People are increasingly open about who they are. Businesses who embrace this will thrive in the longer term.</p>

                            If the workplace atmosphere isn't great, it can foster a toxic company culture and push employees to pack up their desks and look elsewhere for work.<br>
                            Increased staff turnover then leads to higher recruiting costs. If your employees feel comfortable, included and valued they're less likely to look for jobs elsewhere.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">There is a fear among some managers that having too diverse a workforce will create more arguments and reduce productivity.<br>
                            But in reality, however, increased diversity brings a broad range of experience, skills and backgrounds which can certainly have a positive impact.<br>
                            In an inclusive environment, teamwork and co-operation can thrive, driving a much more productive workforce. As well as finding that ethnically diverse workforce's are more financially successful, McKinsey also found that companies with a more even gender balance are 25% more likely to outperform those who do not.</p>

                            By opting for diversity, you're opening the business up to a much wider talent pool and a much better chance of getting the right person through the door for a role.<br>                            
                            Diversity is inclusive of many factors, and one of them is age. Both older and younger generations can benefit from their respective experience and youth.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">Effective problem-solving often involves working with others. And if those people all have different experiences, backgrounds and educations, then it can lead to new and innovative ideas (which might not otherwise have come up).<br>
                            Scott E. Page describes in his book, The Difference, the addition of diversity in teams as 'super-additivity'. With a diverse collection of people working together, one can make an improvement, then others in the group can improve on that and so on.<br>                            
                            Essentially, Page says that improvement builds on improvement in a way that it would not if everyone had similar backgrounds, skills and experience.</p>

                        <p class="card-text">There are plenty of stats which show that boardrooms are still dominated by white males.<br>
                            For example, in the UK's biggest companies, in 2015 there were fewer women than there are men named John on the boards of FTSE firms.<br>
                            Now, nearly all FTSE 100 firms have at least one minority ethnic board member - but we've still got a long way to go.<br>                            
                            Yet, boardrooms need to reflect the changing demographics of our world, and by having a diverse boardroom a company can benefit from a much wider range of experience.</p>

                            Staff with similar backgrounds can also help promote better understanding between your business and your different customers, as well as help increase your market share.<br>

                    <p class="font-italic">"Functional bias is a problem for teams facing new uncertain and complex situations because, with little cognitive diversity, the team will have limited ability to see things differently, engage in different ways (e.g., experiment versus analyzing), or create new options.<br><br>
                        Similarly, when organizations initiate change programs, they often seek out and identify advocates or change agents to support activities. Those selected often have a similar approach to change.<br><br>
                        This lack of cognitive diversity has two impacts. First, it reduces the opportunity to strengthen the proposition with input from people who think differently.<br>
                        Second, it fails to represent the cognitive diversity of the employee population, reducing the impact of the initiatives.<br><br>
                        To overcome these challenges, make sure your recruitment processes identify difference and recruit for cognitive diversity. And when you face a new, uncertain, complex situation, and everyone agrees on what to do, <span class="text-highlight">find someone who disagrees and cherish them."</span></p>
