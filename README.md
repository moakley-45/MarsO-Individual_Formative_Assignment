# Diversity&Inclusion

This project is aiming to create a single page site, built through the trinity of HTML, CSS and Javascript, to create a responsive, professional and stable site that can be improved upon in future iterations.

The site itself - “Diversity&Inclusion”- is to serve as a reference-point for professionals; offering tips, guidance, information and further references for users on how to promote diversity and inclusion within their work-places and teams.

This user-base - the professional/ business sector - and the linked user-stories have greatly influenced the planning of the structure and aesthetics of the site.   

The tentative plan for the site’s construction is to go through multiple rounds of development, starting with Round 1 and the creation of the MVP for the site. After this has been completed, the site will be deployed to Github Pages, under the ‘Release early, release often’ principle. 

This will allow for easier testing, and I can then move on to adding new features into the site with each new round of development, and creating an easy-to-replicate structure for future updates and iterations.

## UX/UI 

### Site Goals
 The goal of the site is offer information to business professionals. As such, users will want to be able to easily navigate the website to find information relating to profressional practise. 

### Design choices

I have tailored the images selected to stick to this professional vibe, and I have picked a muted but still c
olourful colorscheme, with orange (#d1911c) as a highlight and a greenish-blue as a base color. I would have chosen a more true blue as a basis as this is very common in the business world with its calming effect - [facebook, X/Twitter, LinkedIn](https://www.wired.com/2016/09/popular-color-internet/) and others all use blue as their main color, for example - but I am blue-tone color-blind, so this would have made development a literal head-ache for me, hence the shift to green as my main background color (#213438). I have used white (#ffffff) as my text color for clarity and a soft grey (#58646c) for feature-backgrounds to offer visual contrast

### User stories

As the site developer, I want the site to be resposive across all three main view-port sizes, to ensure all users can use it as expected.
As a business professional, I want a site that is tailored to my demographic and feels 'business' when I navigate it.
As a business professonal, I want a site that illustrate the real value of the content, with examples from trusted sources.
As a visitor, I want a dynamic site with imagery and color, so I am not bored while browsing.
As a technical professional, I want content with facts and figures, so the information seems trustworthy.
As the site developer, I want the site to be easy to maintain and update, so my future work is as easy as possible.

## Testing 

I'm pleased to report that all sections have been teste for responsiveness on Mobile, Tablet and Desktop sizes.

I found a bug with how my already-minimal navigation bar was bunching up and looking ugly on Mobile sizes - this was the catalyst for deciding to remove this entirely and implement the drop-down navigation bar model on Mobile instead, as this cleanly resolved the issue and made for a much cleaner look. 

The tablet View is definitely not as aesthetically pleasing as I would prefer, and with more time I would definitely use more Media Queries and tailor and fine-tune how the Benefits Section looks on Tablet view - some of the boxes here fail to line up neatly with the buttons covering the final line of text, but all the text is still easy-to-read and legible on both Mobile and Desktop view, so I am counting this as a 'win' for now:

- CSS
  - No errors were found when passing through the official [(Jigsaw) validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2Fvalidator.w3.org%2Fnu%2F%3Fdoc%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fcode-institute-org.github.io%252Flove-running-2.0%252Findex.html&profile=css3svg&usermedium=all&warning=1&vextwarning=&lang=en#css)
![css_validator](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88d83c6d-34c4-49f8-aee3-e7c1d063fd2b) 

### Unfixed Bugs

- The issue with text overlap on Tablet view on the Benefits section - this would need a re-work of the section, which was not currently possible to complete in the time provided but could be done in a future round of development. As the section is usable with no issue on Mobile and Desktop, this has been left as a 'Nice to fix' level issue, rather than a 'Must fix'. 

## Deployment


- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: 
  - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab 
  - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
  - Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
